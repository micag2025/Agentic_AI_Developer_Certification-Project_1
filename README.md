Please, have a  quick look at the draft of Project_Pubblication.md file that is enclosed in this repo.  

**Few remarks** : 
- The draft has been built up following the above [‚úÖ Submission Checklist](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/aaidc-module-1-project-foundations-of-agentic-ai-your-first-rag-assistant-4n07ViGCey0l)  and [Project 1 Submission Guidelines - Agentic AI Developer Certification (AAIDC-Week3)](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/project-1-submission-guidelines-agentic-ai-developer-certification-aaidc-week3-BblNcQTBi5Os)  
 
To complete this project, you need to submit :  
1. üìù Project Publication  
Create a short publication on the Ready Tensor platform that:
   - Describes your project, what it does, and how it works    
   - Follows best practices from our [Technical Evaluation Rubric](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/WsaE5uxLBqnH) for the Tool / App /  Software Development category    
   - Meets at least 70% of the listed criteria    

- Feel free to enclose any comments or suggestions that might be relevant for the pubblication
- I would like to ask you your view for few issues on the following sections:
   - _Title_ :
      - option1 : Agentic AI Developer Certification: Course Project: Build the RAG-Powered AI Assistant Ready Tensor Publication Explorer
      - option2 : Agentic AI Developer Certification: A RAG-powered AI assistant for a "Tensor Publication Explorer" using LangChain
      - option 3 : ? other suggestions are welkom!

   ```
10. Run the tool on the [sample dataset of the ReadyTensor publications](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HAqLXL2W-sh8hqoBb1iSauJ_0wZVRxB9).


## Usage Examples 
This tool is ideal for document summarization, academic research, and more.
Below are several usage examples of a RAG-powered AI assistant for a "Tensor Publication Explorer" using LangChain. The assistant is built to help users explore and understand scientific publications in TensorFlow.
- _Get summaries of a paper or topic_  Eventually enclose the snippet code and output 
- _Chat with a specific paper_         Eventually enclose the snippet code and output 
- 
Here are some realistic use-case examples of a RAG-powered AI Assistant using LangChain to explore Tensor publications, broken down by specific fields like Academia and Development.
- _Use Cases in Ready Tensor_ : 
- _Use Cases in Academia_ : Literature Review Automation, Semantic Paper Search for Proposal Writing
- _Use Cases for Developers / Engineers_ :  Code Example Extraction, Model Comparison for System Design,
- _Use in Institutions or Enterprises_ : Knowledge Management, Research Assistant for Scientific Editors

## API Documentation
API keys stored in environment variables for secure access.
Model used ? 
This API provides endpoints to query and interact with ML/Tensor research papers using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline powered by LangChain.
